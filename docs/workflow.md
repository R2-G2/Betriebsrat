# Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Specification**: The human developer describes new features, changes, or fixes needed
2. **AI Implementation**: The AI analyzes the requirements and implements the changes
3. **Human Review**: The developer reviews the changes without directly modifying the code
4. **Feedback Loop**: If changes are needed, the developer provides feedback to the AI
5. **AI Refinement**: The AI makes further adjustments based on feedback
6. **Commit Authorization**: Code is only committed and pushed when explicitly authorized by the developer
