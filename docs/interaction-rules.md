# Rules for Interaction

- **Clear Requirements**: Provide clear, detailed requirements for what needs to be implemented
- **Specific Feedback**: When changes are needed, be specific about what isn't working
- **Learning Adaptation**: The AI will adapt to the project's coding style and patterns over time
- **Documentation**: All significant changes should be documented in comments and commit messages
- **Commit Control**: All commits and pushes require explicit authorization from the developer
- **Language**: Communication will be in German, while code, comments, documentation, CSS classes etc. will remain in English
- **Website Text**: Visible text on the website will be in German
