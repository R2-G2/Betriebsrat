# Cursor Project Rules

## Development Rules

- The developer will never directly touch or edit code
- All code modifications will be performed exclusively by AI
- Requirements and feedback will be provided by the developer
- AI will implement all new features and make all code changes
- File organization follows best practices for web development
- Code will only be committed and pushed when explicitly authorized by the developer

## Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Specification**: The human developer describes new features, changes, or fixes needed
2. **AI Implementation**: The AI analyzes the requirements and implements the changes
3. **Human Review**: The developer reviews the changes without directly modifying the code
4. **Feedback Loop**: If changes are needed, the developer provides feedback to the AI
5. **AI Refinement**: The AI makes further adjustments based on feedback
6. **Commit Authorization**: Code is only committed and pushed when explicitly authorized by the developer

## Rules for Interaction

- **No Direct Code Editing**: Humans should never directly edit the codebase
- **Clear Requirements**: Provide clear, detailed requirements for what needs to be implemented
- **Specific Feedback**: When changes are needed, be specific about what isn't working
- **Learning Adaptation**: The AI will adapt to the project's coding style and patterns over time
- **Documentation**: All significant changes should be documented in comments and commit messages
- **Commit Control**: All commits and pushes require explicit authorization from the developer
- **Language**: Communication will be in German, while code, comments, documentation, CSS classes etc. will remain in English
- **Website Text**: Visible text on the website will be in German

## Best Practices

- Start with clear, concise requirements
- Break complex features into smaller, manageable tasks
- Provide context about how new features should integrate with existing code
- When giving feedback, explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Regularly review the entire project to ensure consistency
- Review all changes thoroughly before authorizing commits
